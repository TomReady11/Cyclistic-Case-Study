# Cyclistic-Case-Study
In this case study I assume the role of a data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The executives believe the future sucess of the company depends on maximizing the number of Subscribers. I will be using a the data across the entire year of 2018 to further understand the differences between subscribers and customers and make informed reccomendations to executives.
