# Cyclistic-Case-Study
In this case study I assume the role of a data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The executives believe the future sucess of the company depends on maximizing the number of Subscribers. I will be using a the data across the entire year of 2018 to further understand the differences between subscribers and customers and make informed reccomendations to executives. 
## Scenario 
Cyclistic Bike-Share is a Chicago based bike-share company that has two types of customers. It has three options for customers to choose from: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Cyclistic considers riders that have annual passes to be members. While single-ride and full-day pass users are customers. Financial analysts with Cyclictic have concluded that members are much more profitable than regular customers. Due to this the executives believe that focusing on increasing members is the most important thing for Cyclistic's success moving forward.
